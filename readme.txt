Installation Instructions:
This project was run on an XAMPP server which has APACHE and MySQL installed.
We used this approach as we used php to establish a connection to the database 
and manipulate its data. If the site is run on server.js the php files will not be supported

XAMPP can be downloaded here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
There is a small change to be made in the httpd.conf file regarding the IP address and port number 
This video explains it well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8N4FEQWyY
Once that is installed in your local disk (C:) head to C:\xampp\htdocs and empty out any files present.
Next, place our zipped up files into the htdocs folder.
Finally, if XAMPP is opened with APACHE and MySQL enabled you should be able to
visit our site through http://localhost:8080/
Sorry for the trouble.
